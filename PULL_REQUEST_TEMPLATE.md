# [CAP-25] FEAT: (FE) Implement Suspense and Loading States for Details and History Views

## Summary
This PR implements React Suspense components and skeleton loading states throughout the MMDC Student Portal frontend to improve user experience during data fetching operations. The implementation focuses on providing visual feedback for billing details, user management tables, and pagination components.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Components
- **Suspense Pagination** (`suspense-pagination.tsx`)
  - Added skeleton loading state for pagination controls
  - Improved UX during page navigation

- **Billing Suspense Components** (`billing/suspense.tsx`)
  - `SuspendedBillingTableRows`: Loading states for billing data tables
  - `SuspendedBillingPrefaceCard`: Skeleton cards for billing overview
  - `SuspendedBillingBreakdown`: Loading state for billing breakdown tables
  - `SuspendedBillingInstallment`: Loading cards for installment information

- **User Management Suspense** (`user-management/suspense.tsx`)
  - `SuspendedUserTableRows`: Loading states for user data tables
  - Consistent skeleton UI for user profile information

### Key Features
- ✅ Consistent loading state design using Mantine UI skeleton components
- ✅ Proper sizing and spacing to match actual content layout
- ✅ Circular skeletons for profile pictures and icons
- ✅ Responsive design support for different screen sizes
- ✅ Improved perceived performance during data loading

## Technical Implementation
- Used React Suspense patterns for better loading state management
- Leveraged Mantine UI's Skeleton component for consistent visual design
- Maintained component structure to match actual content layout
- Implemented responsive grid layouts for different screen sizes

## Testing
- [x] Frontend builds successfully
- [x] API types generated correctly
- [x] Components render without errors
- [x] Loading states display proper skeleton structure

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users now see meaningful loading indicators instead of blank screens
- **Performance Perception**: Application feels more responsive with immediate visual feedback
- **Consistency**: Standardized loading states across billing and user management sections

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding loading states for other sections (enrollment, notifications)
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling
- Add animation to skeleton loading states for enhanced visual appeal
